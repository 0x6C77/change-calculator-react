## Coin Calculator - React edition
A React rewrite of [my original coin calculator](https://github.com/0x6C77/change-calculator) in 2 hours or less. Given a number of pennies it [will, should] calculate the minimum number of Sterling coins needed to make that amount.

#### [live demo](https://0x6c77.github.io/change-calculator-react/)

#### What I don't like about react
* JSX
* Manual binding of functions
* Lack of two-way data binding
* No templating language (leading to unintuitive loops, ifs etc..)
* Assigning key in loops
