## Coin Calculator - React edition
A rewrite of [my original coin calculator](https://github.com/0x6C77/change-calculator) in react. Given a number of pennies it [will, should] calculate the minimum number of Sterling coins needed to make that amount.


#### What I don't like about react
* JSX
* Manual binding functions
* Lack of two-way data binding
* No templating language (leading to unintuitive loops, ifs etc..)
* Assigning key in loops
